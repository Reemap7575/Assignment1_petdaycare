---

## ðŸ“Œ Purpose

This assignment demonstrates the importance of preparation and organization in the software development process. It is designed to help understand how to approach initial client meetings by identifying assumptions, formulating clarifying questions, and breaking down project requirements. The goal is to enter the client meeting well-prepared, ensuring a productive conversation despite potentially limited face time with stakeholders.

## ðŸ“– Scenario Summary

The client is a **Pet Daycare** business facing major issues with both **employee and client onboarding**. The onboarding process is inconsistent, time-consuming, and causes frustration for all involved:

- **Owners** are frustrated because new employee training takes too long (around 3 months).
- **Employees** struggle with onboarding new clients due to a lack of standardized process.
- **Customers** find the client onboarding experience confusing and difficult to follow.

The goal is to prepare for an initial meeting with the client, where we will clarify the true needs, document assumptions, and identify the steps needed to create a streamlined onboarding system for both employees and clients.
